/**
 *  The CMDevice class handles all communications with the physical device. Objects are generally intialized by the CMDeviceManager with the UDID it detects however you could also manually initalize a CMDevice providing you know the UDID of the device and know that it is connected.
 *
 *  Before you try to interact with the physical device, you must make sure that you are connected to the device. You are also responsible for disconnecting when you have finished making requests to the device.
 *  It has become apparent that if you are connected to the device but idle for more than 20seconds, the connection is broken but libimobiledevice does not inform us about this. This would mean that the CMDevice object thinks that it is still connceted however when making a request, the application will crash with a SIGPIPE error. To avoid this, you must ensure that you disconnect yourself when you have finished requesting information.
 *
 *  Example:
 *      CMDevice *device = ...
 *
 *      if (!device.connected) {
 *          NSError *error = nil;
 *          [device connect:&error];
 *          if (error) {
 *              NSLog(@"Error connecting to device: %@", error);
 *          }
 *      }
 *
 *      NSError *error = nil;
 *      id response = [device readDomain:nil key:nil error:&error]; //reads all the information in the default domain.
 * 
 *      if (error) {
 *          NSLog(@"Error reading from the device: %@", error);
 *      }
 *      else {
 *          NSLog(@"Got response from the device: %@", response);
 *      }
 *
 *      [device disconnect]; //we've finsihed reading from the device so lets disconnect.
